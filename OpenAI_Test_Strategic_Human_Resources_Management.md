Strategic human resource management came into being in the 1980s. In 1981, Devanna, Fombrum and Tichy proposed and deeply analyzed the relationship between corporate strategy and human resources in Human Resource Management: A Strategic View. It marks the emergence of strategic human resource management. In 1984, the publication of the book "Management of Human Capital" by Beer et al marked the leap from human resource management to strategic human resource management. Simply put, strategic human resource management is to systematically connect people with the enterprise. It will be human resources as a competitive advantage of primary resources, emphasizing human resource planning, policy and practice, can obtain vertical matching and within the enterprise and enterprise strategic activity level matching between the competitive advantage of human resource configuration, and to emphasize all human resources activities are in order to achieve the business goal. Compared with the previous HRM, strategic HRM believes that human resources are the key factor to determine the success or failure of enterprises; Its core function is to participate in the strategic decision-making of the enterprise, advocate and promote the reform according to the needs of the internal and external environment, and carry out the overall human resource planning and practice activities of the enterprise. It is a dynamic and multi-faceted continuous connection with the strategic planning, and its function is directly integrated into the formation and implementation of the enterprise strategy.

### I rephrased this for my father, in plain language a second grader can understand:

"In the 1980s, people realized that the human resources department was important, and that it should be included in the strategic planning of the company. It was a big deal because the human resources department was not always included in the strategic planning of the company."

The term "strategic human resources management" was coined by Beer, Lawler, and Spreitzer in their 1984 book "Management of Human Capital". The term was used to describe a new approach to human resources management that focused on the strategic role of human resources in the organization.
