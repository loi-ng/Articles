Here is the background information on your task

CoffeeCo is a global coffee company and is facing a decline in same-store sales in China due to market saturation and intense competition. Apart from competitive threat, CoffeeCo is also facing challenges such as collecting and analyzing customer data to target individual customers. DigitalBCG has been engaged to transform the digital customer journey and explore ways technology can be used to increase customer engagement and same-store sales.

The Consultant, Evelien, held an initial team meeting. The team thinks that customers could be more seamlessly engaged in their customer journey and a key way to do this is by updating the existing mobile app.

The Consultant wants a client discussion deck laying out emerging digital trends in the F&B industry, including a section on how other F&B companies have increased customer engagement through the use of mobile apps. After discussion with your team, you have identified the need to do some market research and develop 2 case studies of best-in-class engagement apps in F&B.

Here is your task

Your first task today is to do some market research and identify examples of apps that have successfully improved customer engagement for F&B players. 

Don't “boil the ocean” and run an exhaustive search to benchmark all food industry apps. Instead, focus on what the leading players are doing. Identify 2 best-in-class examples, and identify the key features that have resulted in a substantial improvement in engagement.

Please develop three to four slides covering two key areas for each case:

    Company background and challenges faced by the company and why they introduced the app
    Key features of the app, and their objectives

Here is the background information on your task

After a discussion with the BCG project team, the client team agreed to improve the existing mobile app. The team’s task is now to identify what features should be included in the app.

The Principal, Daniel, wants you to think from the customers’ perspective and in an agile mindset to brainstorm potential features that can be included in the app.

Here is your task

Part A:

The team has developed a customer journey map. As you were the one who did the best practice market research, the team would like your views on which customer pain points we should focus on. Summarize your thoughts in a short email.

Part B:

After a long discussion during the case team meeting, it was agreed that the focus area will be personalization. You will now need to brainstorm ideas to improve personalization of customer messages to increase ticket size and frequency of purchases from existing customers. Rather than just creating a long list of options, you should consider how you can group them into a number of logical categories that between them are collectively exhaustive, i.e., they cover the option space entirely.

Helpful Hints:

    A good way to do option generation is to first brainstorm, then categorize, and then brainstorm again
    Categories can be part of a formula, two diametrically opposite alternatives, or form a process.

Using the task template in the resources section below, develop a PowerPoint slide to showcase your recommendations.

Note: please complete the previous task 'Use Case Development' before commencing this task.

The second consultant in the project team, Julia, has just called you to give you an update from the client meeting she just had:

The client has valued your proposal a lot - however, they have done some thinking on their side as well and are pretty sure - going forward - they want to use the features and criteria they have developed despite the suggestion from our side. However, your work hasn't been for nothing  - it has helped you to dive into the context much deeper!

The client is now asking you to have a look at the features they are thinking of and the criteria they would like to apply to take their decision.

Here is the background information on your task

Based on the initial use case development, the team ran a couple of sprints to develop two features for the existing mobile app. The team managed to build these two features and ran several market validation to test how the various customer value propositions are resonating and converting customers. 

Note: Sprint is a term used in Agile project management. In Agile project management, large tasks are broken down into smaller bite-sized pieces for people to execute in the next 1-2 weeks. Teams give individual daily updates, and then the sprint culminates with “demo sessions” to demonstrate the progress made on the product or analysis. It gives sufficient room for teams to pivot after testing and gathering feedback from end-users. The traditional way of using Gantt charts (which plan a project from end to end) to run projects does not allow you to change direction without much implication.

Each pilot ran for a week. In the first pilot, a personalized offer was sent to all CoffeeCo app users where they get a 10% discount on the large drink if they make a purchase within 24 hours. In the second pilot, a personalized recommendation was sent to all CoffeeCo app users where users who upgrade their drink to large size are entitled to a 50% discount on a pastry that complements the drink. The team have gathered some data and would like to analyze the data and evaluate which feature is more effective.

Sub-task 1:

Think through what key performance indicators (KPIs) can be used to measure the performance of each feature.

Sub-task 2:

Think through what data would you need to collect in order to make this assessment.

Sub-task 3:

The team has received some raw data from the client in MS Excel. The Consultant, Evelien, wants you to analyze the data and evaluate the impact should each pilot (separately) be scaled up nationwide.

You are advised to calculate the impact on the revenue and profits pool as well as the average ticket size.

Sub-task 4:

Create a slide to showcase the impact of each pilot run and the revenue impact if the pilot run is scaled up to the entire China market.

Here is your task

At BCG, agile project management methodologies are embraced to increase speed of product development. You may not have realized it but you have just gone through the agile methodology where we design, test, gather feedback and iterate fast.

If you are taking on the role of product manager, how would you organise the next sprint to build and test new features incrementally?

Have a think through the objectives across different work streams and draft a new set of Epics and User Stories to build and test a new feature.

Then go to Trello and create a board to capture your thoughts, and submit a screenshot of your completed board.

Hint: Using the resources section below, please read up on agile project management methodologies online, download Trello and use the template as an example of how to set out your findings.
