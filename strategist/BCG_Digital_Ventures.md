# Task 1 - Strategic Design

Help define a new business opportunity for a major financial institution in the document management space.

Identify small business customers' frictions, and come up with a new business idea.
Creating new ideas to solve customer frictions.

## Step 1 Get your instructions from your supervisor

Watch this video and hear about your task. 
Strategic Design

## Step 2 Here is the background information on your task

You have been asked to uncover 2-3 business customer frictions in the data extraction and analysis space. 

Once that is done, you are to identify helpful technology trends and companies, and then create a customer value proposition and 2-3 features to solve these customer problems.  

The data extraction and analysis space/industry helps companies make sense of unstructured data, to find new and valuable information that was previously inaccessible. It does this by converting data into ‘structured’ formats that can then be understood by people and programs in a more logical way.  

Data can be ‘locked’ in a variety of areas, mostly it is locked within a physical or digital document (Word document, Excel, PDF etc.) 

## Step 3 Here is your task

Part 1 - Customer Frictions

Through customer interviews, or secondary research, find 2 customer frictions for small to medium-sized business customers in the area of data extraction and analysis.

For customer interviews, aim to speak with people that work with physical documents in companies (e.g. accountants), and need to extract and analyze lots of information from them.

You need to synthesize your interviews/desk-research into the two most interesting frictions. These should be ‘punchy’ insights with a quote or stat to back each one up.

Part 2 - Trends

Find 3-4 interesting trends for the data extraction and analysis industry that demonstrate why we should launch a new business in this industry right now. These trends can cover technology, social trends , and/or new companies or products.

For each trend/company, please tell us what it is, and why it’s relevant for us to know. 

Part 3 - Value proposition and features

Come up with an idea and a customer value proposition (CVP) that capitalizes on these frictions and trends. 

To bring your CVP/idea to life, come up with 2-3 features that solve the problems you have identified. These should be kept high-level, and easy to understand. Give your new business a name!

In the resources section below you will find a task template to complete for parts 1, 2 and 3. Submit your final PowerPoint deck in section 5 once you're done!

Your answers should be ‘punchy’ as if you were creating a pitch deck to present your idea to other people. 

We expect this task to take approximately 2 to 3 hours to complete.

## Step 4 Resources to help you with the task

We recognise that these tasks are challenging and that there are undoubtedly phrases and terminology you may not have heard before – don’t worry! We have tried to make this experience as true to life as possible and therefore our ask is that you attempt to seek out independent sources of information and do your own research, as required, to help guide you through the tasks.

## Step 5 Submit your work 

You may only credit this task to your CV if you make a genuine attempt at the work. You may resubmit work, iterate upon and reattempt work as many times as you want.

# Task 2 - Experience Design

Map the customer journey, develop personas, and identify features to solve human needs
Understanding the patient path to improve the experience

## Step 1  Get your instructions from your supervisor

Watch this video and hear about your task. 
Experience Design

## Step 2 Here is the background information on your task

You have been asked to identify 2 diabetes patient personas, and 2 carer personas that can be used to help the team better understand who they are designing for. 

Once that is done, you are to map the customer journey for these two types of people, patient and carer. The journey map should show the stage, touchpoints , and pain points from Diagnosis, through to Gathering Tools and Information. 

Lastly, you are to create an experience and a set of features that will help address the needs of patients and carers at each step of the journey. 

The experience and features should be based on building a smartphone application that will be used at home by patients, and carers to assist with diabetes management. Diabetes management is long-term, self-driven care of diabetes within the context of your life.

This task does not require you to consider use in hospitals or for life-threatening diabetic moments e.g. diabetic comas etc. 

## Step 3 Here is your task

Part 1 - Customer Personas

Through customer interviews, or secondary research, identify two different types of diabetic patients, and two different types of carers.

    For patients, this difference could be in attitude (e.g. proactive or reactive), life-stage (e.g. young or old) or diabetes stage (e.g. recently diagnosed or severity increased).
    For carers, this difference could be in job (e.g. nurse or dietician), technology savviness (e.g. early adopter or laggard) or workload (e.g. time poor or free to focus on 1-2 patients)

You need to synthesize your interviews/desk-research into a quick description and a few quotes for each of the personas.

Part 2 - Customer Journey map

The customer journey should capture the stages, touchpoints, and pain points for diabetes patients, and their carers. 

Choose one of your patient personas, and one of your carer personas.

Through research and/or interviews, plot the pain points (problems people face) for the patients and carers at each of the key stages. Focus on the single biggest problem that you identify at each step, rather than many pain points. This will help create clarity for ideation later. 

Part 3 - Experience and feature map

Assume that you are creating this for a smartphone application. Use the same persona.

Look at the touch points that you highlighted in the customer journey map, and identify 4-5  key moments (e.g. finding a carer to help with my treatment) .

For each of these Key Moments, identify the experience you want to create on the app that would make that moment better.

For each experience step, create 1-3 features that will help create that experience for the user (patient or carer).

In the resources section below you will find some useful additional information and a task template to complete for parts 1, 2 and 3. Submit your final PowerPoint deck in section 5 once you're done!

We expect this task to take approximately 2 to 3 hours to complete.

## Task 3 - Product Management

Prepare a feature roadmap for a new digital product
Building a next-gen personalization engine

## Step 1  Get your instructions from your supervisor

Watch this video and hear about your task. 
Product Management

## Step 2 Here is the background information on your task

The team has provided you with some background on the frictions that they have found in the market, and a brief overview of the idea they’ve imagined. You can find these in the attached materials. The idea is called Telescope, and it is a promotion system for retailers, to send highly personalized and contextual promotions to their customers. 

Assume that the corporate partner BigShop has provided you with access to their Proprietary Customer Data Analytics Tool (PCDAT).

The team wants you to identify the key set of technical features (e.g push notification system) for customers and for retailers. 

After this, they’d like you to create a high-level overview of how the solution could work. This will make it easier to explain to potential retailers. 

Lastly, they’d like you to show how these could roll out on a roadmap . 

The experience will largely be on mobile and desktop for customers, and for retailers it will be a largely automated system but controlled by operations staff.

## Step 3 Here is your task

Part 1 - Technical Feature overview

Read through the frictions, suggested features, and customer experience supplied in the materials.

Identify 2-3 customer and retailer technical features/elements that would be needed in order to create this product and experience.

Part 2 - Solution overview

Outline how this solution would work. For example, how could the data flow from customers to retailers.

As this is a high-level overview, keep your answer to 4-6 steps to demonstrate how it would work.

You should tailor your message towards non-technical people, therefore, it should be simple to read either in presentation or alone.

Part 3 - Roadmap

Your roadmap should follow three stages:

(1) MVP (minimum viable product) this is the first thing you will launch;

(2) Phase 2, which is the next iteration of your product where you can introduce new services; and

(3) Phase 3 where you typically look at expansion.

Roadmaps are not timelines per se, they do not have a strict date for each part, but should be considered different horizons. They could be very short, or very long.

Your roadmap should be split between Customer-focused (B2C) and Retailer-focused (B2B).

In the resources section below you will find some useful additional information and a task template to complete for parts 1, 2 and 3. Submit your final PowerPoint deck in section 5 once you're done! Please note the template provided is stimulus, you can use it or create your own to complete your answer.

We expect this task to take approximately 2 hours to complete.

## Task 4 - Venture Architecture 

Determine the market opportunity and business model
Help your team understand the business viability of a venture concept

## Step 1  Get your instructions from your supervisor

Watch this video and hear about your task. 
Venture Architecture 

## Step 2 Here is the background information on your task

We are half way through a 12-week innovation sprint, where our corporate partner has asked us to identify several potential startup concepts that they could take into market. 

You will be working with a small multi-disciplinary team on a concept called “Rentlord” in order to understand whether the concept is viable.

Rentlord is a platform that offers Landlords a suite of property management services to reduce or remove their reliance on traditional Property Managers.

We would like you to conduct a market assessment for Rentlord, including sizing the opportunity, understanding the competitive landscape for such a solution in Australia, and explaining how the business model would work.

## Step 3 Here is your task

Part 1 - Market sizing 

Using publicly-available information and justifiable assumptions, calculate the total market, addressable market and share of market for Rentlord.

Describe the potential revenue models that may be adopted, such as “recurring subscription fee”. Include who would pay and how much would be reasonable.

Part 2 - Competitive landscape 

Concisely describe the market in which Rentlord plays in and then conduct desktop research to identify the top competitors in Australia (or around the world).

Start by thinking about the value chain Rentlord plays into. Explore the internet for startups and established incumbents that would be potential competitors (or alternatives) to Rentlord across this value chain. Think about competitors in relation to who they target (i.e. tenants or landlords).

Part 3 - How it works

Describe how the business would work in practice. It will be important to show (1) who the users of the app are; (2) what features they benefit from; and (3) the flow of money. Think about how this works during the setup of a property as well as ongoing management.

In the resources section below you will find a task template to complete for parts 1, 2 and 3. Submit your final PowerPoint deck in section 5 once you're done! Please note you should only complete the three slides in the task template labelled 'template'.

We expect this task to take approximately 2 hours to complete.

## Step 4 Resources to help you with the task

You will be working with a small multi-disciplinary team on a concept called “Rentlord” in order to understand whether the concept is viable.

Rentlord is a platform that offers Landlords a suite of property management services to reduce or remove their reliance on traditional Property Managers.

We would like you to help our commercial team understand more about the competitive landscape, define a high-level go-to-market strategy and produce ad copy / creative for a validation campaign.

## Step 3 Here is your task

Part 1 - Competitor intelligence

Your task is to (1) select two competitors in Australia and one from the US or UK; (2) determine growth and scale metrics Rentlord could expect based on these benchmarks; and (3) the ads they are running on Facebook.

To complete this task, you will need to use Facebook's ad library feature, as well as websites like LinkedIn, Crunchbase and Similarweb to find information. Note, some websites will not have data, so for these, please just add "N/A"

Part 2 - High-level go-to-market strategy

Identifying the right go-to-market strategy is the key to being able to successfully scale and launch a venture.

Based on your findings from competitive intelligence, your task is to develop a high-level go-to-market strategy for Rentlord. Consider the sales and marketing "tactics" (e.g. SEM / SEO, social media, referral programs, direct salesforce etc.) you could use and how they would help you succeed in market.

Part 3 - Market experiments

For this slide, select a value proposition and create a Facebook ad to test your hypothesis. The Facebook ad should include the copy, image, title, description and call-to-action.

On the right hand side, describe what you are testing, the audience, and the key metrics you would consider for success through this experiment.
In the resources section below you will find a task template to complete for parts 1, 2 and 3. Submit your final PowerPoint deck in section 5 once you're done! Please note you should only complete the three slides in the task template labelled 'template'.

## Glossary - Task 1

Customer Frictions - A problem that a customer faces when trying to do a task (e.g. slow lines at an amusement park), that reveals a new opportunity (e.g. selling food and drinks in lines while people wait)

Tech trends - new and emerging technologies, or new ways that technology is being used e.g. augmented reality in medicine

Customer Value Proposition - the value that a product/company provides to a customer, or the objective/feeling/job that a customer is looking to achieve by purchasing your product (e.g. On demand movies, tv shows, and documentaries; watch what you want, whenever you want, from the comfort of your home).

Why Now - many startups and products may be fantastic, but too 'ahead of their time' (or too lagging) to be successful. Finding the 'Right Time' to launch, when trends and technology align, is incredibly important and can be the difference between success and failure.

Social trends - changes in the way that people are acting, new social movements, or consideration e.g. rise of environmental action and striving for carbon neutrality

## Glossary - Task 2

Touch point - Things that you interact with or need to do when trying to achieve something or go somewhere. Some of the touchpoints at a supermarket are the front entrance, the food displays, people you are served by, the aisle markers, and the check-out kiosk. These provide opportunities for designers to engage and encourage customers to act or feel in a certain way.

Customer Friction / Pain Point - A problem that a customer faces when trying to do a task (e.g. slow lines at an amusement park), that reveals a new opportunity (e.g. selling food and drinks in lines while people wait) 

Experience - Within the context of design, the experience is what you feel, see, hear, touch, smell, when you start engaging with something. This can be at the individual touch point level, what happens at that specific moment, as well as at the overarching level, how some experiences your whole programme, app, or place.  

Product Feature - A particular thing that adds some type of value, or addresses a specific element of the core need of the customer, that is built into the product. A feature could be the shopping cart in ecommerce that allows you to see what you are about to buy, it could be the off-button on a TV remote control, it could be a bigger trolley in a supermarket. The sum total of all product features help create the overarching experience, and each feature should address the core need from a different angle, or serve a required functional purpose. A profile section of an application can be seen as a functional requirement. 

Customer Persona - A character (like from a story) that represents key characteristics, attitudes, and ways of thinking for a group of people. Personas are used to focus the team on solving the needs for a type of person, e.g. a young punk-rock star has very different desires to an aspiring pro-athlete. Different personas require different features and experiences.  

Customer Journey Map - These maps follow the physical or digital movement / progression, emotional ups and downs (pain points, and moments of delight), touch points (interactions), and actors (people from different roles). They progress in stages that are defined by a key objective (e.g. downloading, signup, use, subscribe etc.), and follow how the experience and individual change across those steps. These maps are designed to give designers a complete overview of the current or future experience, and find new opportunities to wow their customers. 

Key Moment - A stage within a journey that can determine whether someone has a really good (moment of delight), or a really bad experience (pain point). For a physical experience, this can be things like the time it takes a waiter to serve you in a restaurant after entering. For a digital experience, this can be what happens after you first open an application and sign up. If a waiter takes too long, it’s a bad experience, if you suddenly get a reward after opening the app, this can be a great experience. 

## Glossary - Task 3

Technical feature - this refers to product components that help drive features. For example, a notification engine is something that sends push notifications to a user’s device. The feature would be the notification you receive as a user, the technical feature is the component that makes it possible. 

Roadmap - the staged approach to releasing technology / products into market. These are typically lists of pain points to be solved, or product features. The purpose of the roadmap is to help the product team focus on what they need to do now vs. later on. Roadmaps typically have a goal for each stage in the roadmap, for example, increased customer loyalty might appear on an early roadmap, whereas conversion to sales might appear on a later roadmap.  

MVP - Minimum Viable Products are the smallest iteration of a product or service that can be created to demonstrate the value to potential customers, and allow them to engage in your service. These are what startups usually launch to market, after which they rapidly change their design and engineering until they are ready to scale their product.
