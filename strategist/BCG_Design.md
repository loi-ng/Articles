Welcome to BCG’s virtual experience program! We’re so excited to have you here with us!

So what exactly is a virtual experience program? It is the perfect opportunity to take on practical tasks similar to what our very own BCGers would work on and get a true feel of what it is like to work at BCG as a strategy consultant, technology consultant, and a designer which will give you deeper understanding on what BCG does and help set you up for success when you decide to apply with us.

BCG partners with leaders in business and society to tackle their most important challenges and capture their greatest opportunities. Our diverse, global teams bring deep industry and functional expertise and a range of perspectives to spark impactful change through leading-edge management consulting as well as data science, technology and design, digital ventures, and business purpose. We work in a uniquely collaborative model across the firm and throughout all levels of the client organization to deliver results that help our clients thrive.

In this virtual experience program, you will gain enviable insight into what it’s like to solve meaningful challenges with our diverse and forward-thinking team. What’s great about our virtual experience program is the flexibility of it. You’ll get to choose the module or modules that you would like to take and complete all of these tasks and modules anywhere and anytime in the world, allowing you to upskill yourself in your own time and pace.

After finishing each module, you’ll be provided with real work sample answers from our leaders and you can see how top-tier consultants and our designers would have tackled each task, so that you can learn from their approach.

Watch this video and hear about your task.

Here is the background information on your task

All design starts with research, and all research starts with a plan. A research plan facilitates alignment between the team members and clients. Being clear about the approach is important to make sure we go out and return with relevant insights. 

We have recently been engaged by an Indonesian Bank to look at the current customer experience of everyday personal banking. There’s a strong belief that the young millennials will very soon form the largest segment for the client and they want to be ready for it.

3
Here is your task

How well do we know the millennials?

We usually kick start our discovery journey by conducting ethnographic research to uncover their intangible attitudes, behaviours, and motivations. We do so by talking to people and observing them in their natural context to understand them at a deeper level. In order to conduct the research, we first devise a research plan to guide the team.

Using the resources provided below, assist the client with preparing a research plan. The plan should give anyone in the team a good understanding of why, what, and how to go about conducting the research. Set your research window to 2 weeks.

Watch this video and hear about your task.

2
Here is the background information on your task

You have conducted a series of ethnographic research and gotten deep into user insights. And it’s time to playback your research at the upcoming client workshop. 

A persona helps to drive alignment to who is the user we are designing for. The content is so rich that it allows one, potentially anyone, to gain insights and empathy just by reading. It also helps the team to define shared understanding for the work ahead.

3
Here is your task

Consolidate your findings into a single page persona.

Analyse and synthesize the materials below to design your persona. We expect you to reference existing online materials on your own to flesh out the details.

Here is the background information on your task

We have put together some questions for you to reflect on your last two design tasks.

It's always a good practice to take a step back to think about what you have learned and reinforce that new knowledge.

3
Here is your task

Have a go at the multiple-choice questions below and check what you've learned during the project. 

Please note there are eight multiple-choice questions to complete in this task. Please be patient as each question loads and note there is only one right answer per question.
