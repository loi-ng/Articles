Strategic Design 
Ethnographic Research


A good research plan covers ...
Objectives of the research
Methodologies to be applied
Timeframe required
Participant criteria

All design starts with research, and all research starts with a plan. A research plan facilitates alignment between the team members and clients. Being clear about the approach is important to make sure we go out and return with relevant insights. 

We usually kick start our discovery journey by conducting ethnographic research to uncover their intangible attitudes, behaviours, and motivations. We do so by talking to people and observing them in their natural context to understand them at a deeper level. In order to conduct the research, we first devise a research plan to guide the team.

## Experience Design

Experience Design

A persona helps...
Drive alignment to who the user is
Gain insights and empathy Define shared understanding for the work ahead

You have conducted a series of ethnographic research and gotten deep into user insights. And it’s time to playback your research at the upcoming client workshop. 

A persona helps to drive alignment to who is the user we are designing for. The content is so rich that it allows one, potentially anyone, to gain insights and empathy just by reading. It also helps the team to define shared understanding for the work ahead.

Consolidate your findings into a single page persona.

Analyse and synthesize the materials below to design your persona. We expect you to reference existing online materials on your own to flesh out the details.

Q1: What is a research plan?
That's right! It's a living document that guides the research team on the goals, methods, and logistical needs for the study. It also helps to ensure coordination and alignment between the researchers to minimise discrepancies.

Q2: Which of the following components are the most critical in a research plan?
Concept Testing, Ideation, Budget
Purpose, Concept Testing, Budget
Purpose, Interview Guides, Methods √
That's right! Beyond these three, we also include goals, participants profile, logistics and timeline. These components will help to give structure and clarity to the researchers.

Q3: What is a persona?
A hypothetical representation of needs, desires, pain points and behaviours of people who share common traits. √
An actual representation of each user.
A fictional representation of a major user group.
The alter ego of a user.
That's right! A persona portrays meaningful and relatable profile for the team to align and reference as they are working through the phases of the project

Q4: What is included in a persona?
Behavioural patterns
Pain points
Basic Demographics
All of the above
Awesome! You are right! While not limited to those mentioned above, one could also get creative and include quotes, goals, environment and tools etc.

Q5: I must follow everything in the research plan
False
Not quite. A well-crafted research plan guides you during sessions and helps learn about the user, but don't forget it just guides. Sometimes the best insights are gathered when you deviate from your plan.
True
Correct! Awesome! Things can go wrong, and you should learn from each session and iterate on the plan.

Q6: Which of the following(s) is a deliverable of the research?
Preliminary findings
Bug list
Summary deck/ report
All of the above
Almost. A mandatory to conclude the research, including but not limited to verbatims, pain points and opportunities.

Q7: A person should not be iterated and changed once final.
That's right! We should always update a persona with new information discovered along the way to ensure it's relevant all the time.

Q8: When do you create a persona?
When I want to improve a product or offering
When I want to enhance promotion or growth
When I'm in the midst of an agile delivery project and writing user stories
When I'm facilitating a workshop
All of the above
Correct! Yes, all of the above. Persona is a flexible and versatile activity in the toolkit and applicable in many situations if used correctly.
