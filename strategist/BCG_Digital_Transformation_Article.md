Impact Assessment & Prioritization
Please use the first four columns to rank the features along the shown criteria on a scale from 1 = very low to 4 = very high. Based on your assessment, please indicate in column 5 the order of priorities you would allocate to the different features from 1 = top priority to 5 = lowest priority. Remember: once you have submitted your answers, you can hover over the red boxes for more information on any incorrect answers.

Customer Experience
Revenue Impact
Low cost to implement
Scalability
Resulting prioritization

Celebratory greetings / messages (E.g. triggered based on country specific external events or cross reference with profile

-4 Hmm... Customers really love this
-3 This could generate quite some revenue - however, might not be the very top performer in this category
-2 From experience, cost for this feature are often underestimated - it's not very cheap!
-4 Okay... What would really be limiting the scale of this feature?
-3 In the end, this feature will not be top priority - however, it's definitely not ending up at the bottom of the list either!

Geo-location targeting (E.g. Alerts on new storeopening / new product in-store / new promotions instore/ nearby stores)

-3 This feature is pretty popular with customers!
-4 For revenue impact, this feature is simply fantastic!
-1 One might not not believe it, but geo-location targeting is indeed very expensive compared to the other features...
-1 Comparing with the other features, the opportunities for scaling this one are actually pretty limited... Don't you think?
-5 Taking all criteria into account, this feature is not ranking that high in the end...

Behavioural pattern triggers (E.g. Remind customers to purchase favourite drink based on data from purchase history)

-4 Think about this again... Which customer whould not love an app understanding her/his every behaviour
-4 Targeting customers in the exactly moments and situations often generates excellent revenue!
-4 Implementing this feature is pretty cheap...
-4 Looks like this could be scaled anywhere with as many people as possible...
-1 No... Looking at the feature's rating across all criteria, this feature should be doing weight better!

Time-based personalized offers (E.g. Remind customers of time lapse since previous purchase)

-2 A purely time-based offer is not really too execiting for customers... 
-3 Revenues impact would be significant - however, not as high as for other feature...
-4 This should rank very similar to behavioural pattern triggers...
-4 This should rank very similar to behavioural pattern triggers...
-2 This feature deserves some prioritization towards most of the others

Weather-sensitive personalization (E.g. Recommend a hot drink when it is raining or when the weather cold)

-3 Recommendation besed on weather definitely appeal more to customers than time-based ones
-3 This must be siimilar to celebratory greetings...
-3 This is not too expensive to implement, there are cheaper features around here though!
-3 There is only few limitations to this feature's scalability!
-4 Yeah... Doesn't look like this feature will be of high priority!

Sprint is a term used in Agile project management. In Agile project management, large tasks are broken down into smaller bite-sized pieces for people to execute in the next 1-2 weeks. Teams give individual daily updates, and then the sprint culminates with “demo sessions” to demonstrate the progress made on the product or analysis. It gives sufficient room for teams to pivot after testing and gathering feedback from end-users. The traditional way of using Gantt charts (which plan a project from end to end) to run projects does not allow you to change direction without much implication.

Numeric ranking
Harvey Balls √
Color Coding
Description in words
Correct! Harvey balls are a great way of visualizing differences In Impact, fulfilment etc. - always Important to Include an explanation of the degrees of filling though!

Q3 - Which of these characteristics is not an element of agile project management?
Sprints
Daily Standups
Retrospectives
Gantt Charts √

Correct! DigitalBCG consultants work closely with a diverse group of stakeholders, including product managers, consumer insight experts, developers, IT architects, data scientists, UX/UI designers and human-centered designers.

Q5 - What is not an advantage of using agile methodology vs. a traditional project management approach?
Applicability to any project √
Faster detection of problems and defects
Greater involvement and satisfaction of stakeholders
Increased collaboration frequency and feedback
Correct! Agile methodology is not suitable for any kind of project. It's not appropriate when facing an unclear project goal, organizations with too large size or too rigid processes and/or unexperienced or non-stress-resistant teams.

Q6 - What can you not do with an agile epic?
Break down into user stories
Measure
Divide into sub-epics √
Manage via Trello
Correct! This is not possible - there is no hierarchy within epics. Next hierarchical level would be user stories.
